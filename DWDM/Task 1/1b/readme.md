The crucial attribute in making credit assessment are: <br>
a) CHECKING <br>
b) FOREIGN <br>
c) OTHER <br>
d) HOUSING <br>
e) HISTORY <br>
f) Duration <br>
<b>Simple Rules for credit assessment:</b><br> 
1) If an applicant is foreign worker other is none i.e., if an applicant is not having any other credits<br>
and checking status is no then the applicant is treated as good<br>
2) If an applicant is foreign worker and then checking status is none then also an applicant is treated 
as good<br>
3) If other is none and checking status is none then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.<br>
4) If OTHER is none and house is own then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.<br>
5) If CHECKING is none then only we can treat an applicant as GOOD.<br>
6) If HISTORY is critical or other existing and OTHER is none then also the applicant is treated as GOOD.<br> 
7) If DURATION is less and HISTORY is critical or other existing then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.<br>
Based on the above attributes, we can make a decision whether to give credit or not.<br>
