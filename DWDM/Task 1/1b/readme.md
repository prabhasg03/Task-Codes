The crucial attribute in making credit assessment are:
a) CHECKING 
b) FOREIGN

e) HISTORY 
f) Duration 
Simple Rules for credit assessment:- 
1) If an applicant is foreign worker other is none i.e., if an applicant is not having any other credits
and checking status is no then the applicant is treated as good<
2) If an applicant is foreign worker and then checking status is none then also an applicant is treated as good<
3) If other is none and checking status is none then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.
4) If OTHER is none and house is own then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.
5) If CHECKING is none then only we can treat an applicant as GOOD.
6) If HISTORY is critical or other existing and OTHER is none then also the applicant is treated as GOOD.
7) If DURATION is less and HISTORY is critical or other existing then also an applicant is treated as GOOD.
Based on the above attributes, we can make a decision whether to give credit or not.
