# Task 2
- [Suppose you use your above model trained on the complete dataset, and <br>
classify credit good/bad for each of the examples in the dataset. What % <br>
of examples can you classify correctly? (This is also called testing on the <br>
training set) Why do you think you cannot get 100 % training accuracy? <br>
Why or Why not?](https://github.com/prabhasg03/Task-Codes/tree/Data-Warehousing-and-Data-Mining/DWDM/Task%202/2a)
- [Check to see if the data shows a bias against "foreign workers" <br>
(attribute 20),or "personal-status" (attribute 9).Did removing these <br>
attributes have any significant effect? Discuss.](https://github.com/prabhasg03/Task-Codes/tree/Data-Warehousing-and-Data-Mining/DWDM/Task%202/2b)
