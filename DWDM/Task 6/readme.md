# Task 6
How can you convert a Decision Trees into "if-then-else rules". Make up your own small Decision 
Tree consisting of 2-3 levels and convert it into a set of rules. There also exist different classifiers 
that output the model in the form of rules - one such classifier in Weka is rules.PART, train this model 
and report the set of rules obtained. Sometimes just one attribute can be good enough in making the 
decision, yes, just one ! Can you predict what attribute that might be in this dataset? OneR classifier 
uses a single attribute to make decisions (it chooses the attribute based on minimum error). Report the 
rule obtained by training a one R classifier. Rank the performance of j48, PART and oneR.
