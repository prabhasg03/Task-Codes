# TASK 5(a)
Do you think it is a good idea to prefer simple decision trees instead of having long complex 
decision trees? How does the complexity of a Decision Tree relate to the bias of the model? 
# Explanation
When we consider long complex decision trees, we will have many unnecessary attributes in the 
tree which results in increase of the bias of the model. Because of this, the accuracy of the model can also 
effected. This problem can be reduced by considering simple decision tree. The attributes will be less and it 
decreases the bias of the model. Due to this the result will be more accurate.So it is a good idea to prefer 
simple decision trees instead of long complex trees.
