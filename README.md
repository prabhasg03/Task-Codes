# TASK 7(Classes)
- [a. Create a class Rectangle. The constructor for this class should take two numeric arguments,
which are the length and breadth. Add methods to compute the area and perimeter of the
rectangle, as well as methods that simply return the length and breadth. Add a method
‘isSquare’ that returns a Boolean value if the Rectangle is a Square.]()

- [a. Write a Python program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid to arrange buttons for
the digits and for the +, -,*, % operations. Add a text field to display the result.]()
- [b. Develop a Python GUI application that receives an integer in one text field, and computes
its factorial Value and fills it in another text field, when the button named “Compute” is
clicked.]()
# TASK 10 (GUI Applications)
- [a. Write a Python program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user
enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2
is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were
not an integer Num2 is Zero, the program should Display an appropriate message in the
result field in Red color.]()
- [b. Write a Python program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one
of three lights: red, yellow, or green. When a radio button is selected, the light is turned
on, and only one light can be on at a time. No light is on when the program starts.]()
